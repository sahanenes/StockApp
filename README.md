## React Redux
I have a lot of components.So i shared some information like authorization and some stock data with child components.
To share these states i used React-Redux library.
It is widely used in the react projects especially if the states are needed to be frequently updated.
We might also use props drilling method to share information but in this case , our project structure would be more complicated.

## Redux-Persist
Redux-Persist takes the Redux state object and saves it to persisted
storage. Then on app launch it retrieves this persisted state and saves it
back to redux.

## React-Router
I used React Router library to enable Client Side Routing
It allows us to build a single-page web application with navigation without
the page refreshing as the user navigates.
